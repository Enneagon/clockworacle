# Game config JSON

Please copy all the files from all the folders under your game-data directory (usually `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Failbetter Games\Sunless Sea`, or similar) into this directory.

## Important

Copy all the `.json` files directly into this folder - do not simply copy all the sub-folders across, because the build system is not smart enough yet to search recursively through subfolders looking for the names it expects.  The `json` folder should contain nothing but a flat list of `.json` files, with no subfolders under it.

**Note:** For a cleaner import of JSON data, omit copying any JSON files with "_import" in the name as these are just a cached copy of the latest game content-update.
